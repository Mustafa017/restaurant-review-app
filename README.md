# Restaurant Reviews App
---
## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

### Specification

 Update the code to resolve responsive web design, make the pages visited to be available offline,
 include aria attributes to enhance web accessibility. 

### What do I do from here?

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
4. Run `npm run serve` to start the server.
5. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:3000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information. 

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.
